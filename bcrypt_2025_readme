Explanation
Dynamic Cost Adjustment: The DynamicCostAdjuster struct allows for dynamic adjustment of the cost factor based on system load. This ensures that the hashing process remains secure without overloading the system.

Parallel Processing: The ParallelGenerateFromPassword function uses goroutines to hash multiple passwords concurrently, improving performance on multi-core systems.

Security Enhancements: The code maintains the use of salts and peppers for enhanced security. It also checks for valid costs and handles errors gracefully to prevent information leaks.

Error Handling: Custom error types like InvalidCostError, InvalidHashPrefixError, and HashVersionTooNewError provide detailed error messages without revealing sensitive information.

Code Organization: The code is organized into clear sections with each function having a specific responsibility, making it easier to maintain and extend.

Usage
To use this code, create an instance of AdaptiveHasher, generate a salt, and then hash passwords using GenerateFromPassword. For parallel hashing, use ParallelGenerateFromPassword with slices of salts and passwords.

Example:
adjuster := NewAdaptiveHasher(MinCost, MaxCost)
salt := []byte{ /* your salt */ }
password := []byte{ /* your password */ }

hash, err := adjuster.GenerateFromPassword(salt, password)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    return
}

fmt.Println(string(hash))


This approach ensures both security and efficiency in password handling.
